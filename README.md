# README

This is a project in which I am building a personal website that includes a blog,
project roadmap, and resume, and whatever else I feel is necessary to add
in the process of becoming a ruby on rails expert.

This project is not intended to be cloned or downloaded but just as a reference
towards my ruby on rails capabilities.

This project is currently using gems such as:
 - postgresql
 - devise
 - bootstrap
 - friendly id
 - tinymce
